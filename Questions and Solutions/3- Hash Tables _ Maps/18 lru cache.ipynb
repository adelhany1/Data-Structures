    "- Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache\n",
    "- It should support the get and put operations.\n",
    "- get(key) : Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.\n",
    "- put(key, value): Set or insert the value if the key is not already present.\n",
    "- When the cache reached its capacity, put(key,value) should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.\n",
    "- The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.\n",
    "- A cache is a memory that stores data for it to be served faster in the future\n",
    "- A cahse's purpose is to speed up data requests\n",
    "- SO what is a LRU ?\n",
    "- Least recently used (LRU) is a policy that is used to remove items from the cache\n",
    "- Stacks follow the LIFO policy, queus follow the FIFO policy, a cache can follow the LRU policy\n",
    "- Example :\n",
    "- cache: [2, 3, 4, 5 ] What this means is that 2 was accessed the most recently, followed by 3, followed by 4 and then 5\n",
    "- Size=4 ,, say we want to add a new item 1 , where would we add it ?\n",
    "- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] we add it at the front of the cache because that means 1 was the most recently used item\n",
    "- problem : cache has a size limit of 4, that means we need to remove an item from the cache\n",
    "- Using the LRU principle, we should remove the least recently used item, aka, the 5\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- Now, say we want to access the 2 using get, what would happen then?\n",
    "- [2, 1, 3, 4] 2 will get to the front of the list because it would now be the most recently used item\n",
    "- Remember, when we want to remove an item from the cache, we remove the LRU item, aka, the last item of our list\n",
    "- ..\n",
    "- What is an LRU cashe ?\n",
    "- It's simply a cache that follows the LRU principle\n",
    "- What are we asked to do?\n",
    "- Given the capacity of the cache, implement a put and a get operation for an LRU cache\n",
    "- Both operations need to be in O(1) time complexity\n",
    "- What data structures should we use?\n",
    "- well, we want fast look ups and fast removals, what data structures should we use?\n",
    "   - For fast look ups, we'll use hash maps\n",
    "   - For fast removals, we'll use double ended queues\n",
    "- Get operation steps:\n",
    "   - If key is not present in map, return -1\n",
    "   - Move the key to the front of the deque\n",
    "   - return the value of our key from the map\n",
    "- EX:        ,,,,    1:10 ,2:11 ,3: 15, 4: 16\n",
    "- cache: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "- get(3):\n",
    "    - 1- remove 3 from deque (from our cashe)\n",
    "    - 2- add 3 to front of deque\n",
    "    - 3- return m[3], which is 15(the original value corresponds to 3)"
